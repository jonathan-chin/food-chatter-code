       "7  When my mother came through Ellis Island you got a physical examination, and had to have a promise of a job. No welfare, food stamps, SNAP, WIC, Social Security. Anything wrong with you they sent you back. We are giving away what they worked and struggled for.                   \n",
       "8  RT : . Please change the rule so SNAP food stamps and WIC program funds can be used to order groceries online for home delivery. Currently it's limited to only in-store pickup. But many disabled people like me cannot drive. Please help us! #SeeUsSchumer #MApoli #CripTheVote     \n",
       "9  Do you have a 3 or 4yo child at home? During difficult times, they need love, safety & healthy food more than ever. WIC can help a& the benefits are easy to use. Many offices are able to help you by phone. Visit & #NYSWIC                                                          \n",
       "10 RT : Don't buy food marked WIC if u can avoid. Don't hoard. Check-in on your neighbors -- esp if elderly or in scary situations! Share what you have -- from a safe distance! Play online games with your friends. Make 2 delish vegan casseroles & drop one off to a homebound friend!"
